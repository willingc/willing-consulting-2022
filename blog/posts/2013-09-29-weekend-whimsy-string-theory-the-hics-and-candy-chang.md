# Weekend Whimsy: String theory, The Hics, and Candy Chang

I'm keeping it short this morning while I write a little software. I'm enjoying some good music, art, and community. Enjoy!

I've been singing this gem from A Capella Science for days now. Catchy lyrics and a little string theory. Awesome.

Topping my playlist this morning is the 'Tangle EP' by [The Hics](http://thehics.com/). Musical goodness with intelligence and creativity. Great sound.

Candy Chang inspired me at LinuxCon 2013 in New Orleans. Planning to watch her keynote again this morning. It's an inspirational presentation of organic change in a community. Try it in your community.
