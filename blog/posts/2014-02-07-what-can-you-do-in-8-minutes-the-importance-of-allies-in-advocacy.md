8 minutes and 18 seconds. It's a small amount of time. Yet, Laila Al-Shamma uses it wisely.
<!-- more -->
Recently, Laila Al-Shamma was honored by GLSEN as the 2013 Student Advocate of the Year. She is someone who makes her local community a better, safer place not just for herself but for others as well. Her strength, honesty, and humility shine through in her acceptance speech.

Some of Laila's wisdom and insights:

</p><blockquote>“If no one around you knows that you are an ally, then you can't claim to be an ally at all.”

“It's my responsibility to pass along the love and acceptance that I get...”

“It doesn't take thousands to mobilize change. It just takes a few motivated people, some help from outside organizations, like GLSEN, and imagine how many more people we could have helped if there were just a few more activists on our side.”</blockquote>

8 minutes and 18 seconds. Watching Laila's speech will inspire you to advocate for your community. A small investment of time can lead to exponential change.

Personally, I am inspired to continue advocating for a diverse community in open source hardware and software development.

<blockquote>I am <a dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fuelingthefuture&amp;src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click">#<strong>fuelingthefuture</strong></a> by recruiting women to the Linux community and advocating for the <a dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/linuxfoundation">@linuxfoundation</a> to invest more in diversity. (my tweet of commitment)</blockquote>
A community built on open communication, courtesy, and respect gets the best results from individual actions. Certainly, the Python community is seeing the benefits of its diversity goals and actions.
