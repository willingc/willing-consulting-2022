## Getting pyenv

Set up pyenv on your M1 Mac.

```zsh
brew install pyenv
```

Add the following to your `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
```

Restart your terminal.

To test that pyenv is installed, run:

```zsh
pyenv --version
```

## Getting miniforge3

In this section, we will install miniforge3, a minimal installer for conda.

```zsh
pyenv install miniforge3
```

```zsh
pyenv versions
```

```zsh
pyenv local miniforge3
```

## Playing with conda

```zsh
conda
```

```zsh
conda list
```

```zsh
conda init
```

## Create a conda environment

```zsh
conda create -y -n napari-env -c conda-forge python=3.9
```

```zsh
conda activate napari-env
```

```zsh
python -m pip install "napari[all]"
```

## Add the dev tools

```zsh
pip install -e ".[pyside,dev]"
```

```zsh
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

```zsh
pre-commit install
```

## Add the testing tools

```zsh
python -m pip install -e ".[testing]"
```

## Run the tests

```zsh
CI=1 pytest
```

## Next steps

1. Run IPython and test napari.
2. Make a change to the code and run the tests.
3. Run an example script.
