## Getting container images

The napari container images are available from the
[GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/napari/napari/pkgs/container/napari).

There are two types of container images available:
- napari
- napari-xpra

Since I'm running a Mac M2, I'm going to use the `napari-xpra` container image since it doesn't require an X server and hopefully will be less finicky.

## Let's run napari

I'm going to use the [napari documentation instructions](https://napari.org/dev/howtos/docker.html#napari-in-docker)
as a guide and I ran these specific steps:

1. Make sure docker is installed and running on your system.
   ```shell
   docker --version
   ```
2. From the root of your napari repo clone or fork, run (note: this could take
   a while even 5 minutes):

   ```shell
   docker build --target napari -t ghcr.io/napari/napari-xpra:latest .
   ```

   ::: {.callout-tip}
   ### Supply chain check
   You can do a quick scan of the image after pulling it using `docker scout`.
   If you are logged into your Docker account, it will make sure that you have
    the latest version of Docker Scout.

3. Run the container:

   ```shell
   docker run -it --rm -p 9876:9876 ghcr.io/napari/napari-xpra
   ```

4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:9876` to see the napari GUI.
   You should see the napari GUI in your browser.

   ::: {.callout-warning}
   ### Check the interactivity of the GUI
   Unfortunately, using this in Safari was popping up a paste dialog
   instead of allowing me to interact with the GUI.
   :::

   I was able to connect to the container using Chrome. It brought
   up an xpra screen. I didn't add any information to the form and
   clicked "Connect". It then brought up the napari GUI.

## Part 2 - Interacting with napari in the browser

In the next post, I'll explore how to interact with napari in the browser.
Stay tuned!
