A Fab Lab is a community space for people to gather and fabricate their dreams
and ideas.

A [formal definition of a Fab Lab](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/faq/) can be
seen at the [MIT Center for Bits and Atoms](http://cba.mit.edu/).
The [Fab Foundation's website](http://www.fabfoundation.org/fab-labs/) has a
map of many Fab Labs around the world and information about the Fab Lab charter
and how to start a Fab Lab.

[Fab Lab San Diego](http://www.fablabsd.org/) is my
little corner for inspiration and outreach. We're located in the heart of
[Makers Quarter](http://www.makersquarter.com/). Here
are a few links to some videos that give a good sense of Fab Lab San Diego,
its mission, and its history.

Learn. Build. Share. Fab Labs and their outreach inspire individuals and build
vibrant, innovative communities. I hope you visit one soon.
