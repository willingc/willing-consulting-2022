PySplashLive brings the power of Jupyter Notebook using JupyterLite, pyodide,
and WebAssembly to the browser. PySplashLive is a live, interactive, and
fun. It's a great way to learn Python and Jupyter. Give it a try. It's free.

*If you leave the browser, you will lose your work. Save your work to a
downloadable file if you want to keep it.*

## New to Notebooks? Try this out.

After the PySplashLive loads, double click on the notebook icon named `meet_swirl.ipynb`. It should launch and introduce you to Swirl.
