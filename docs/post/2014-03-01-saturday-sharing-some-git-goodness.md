Version control and sharing source code help developers hone their craft. If you
are new to developing software, learning git can seem a confusing task. In many
ways, git is elegant in its simplicity and effectiveness.

When learning git, a new user has some decisions to make: use the command line
or a graphical user interface; choosing where to store a remote repository;
selecting a learning path that works for the developer - tutorials, video,
online classes, webcasts, books, cheat sheets, or some combination. Researching
these decisions complicate learning git.

Whatever your learning style, I hope this list of links to some of my favorite
git resources helps you:
