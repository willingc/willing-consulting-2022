What a great way to wrap up a week. There has been so much going on this week
about women and girls in technology. Great work and passion by so many people -
female or male.

Inspiring the next generation of girls...

Building on the achievements of this generation of women...

Honoring the generations of engineers, scientists, businesspersons, and
mothers before us...
