At a recent FabLab San Diego meetup, I was helping others to install
[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org). I wrote some tips down from my install
experience. Here's a link to the [PDF]
(https://github.com/willingc/fablab-sd/blob/master/inkscape%20install.pdf).

I hope these tips help you. Happy creating!
