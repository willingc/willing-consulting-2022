# Weekend Wisdom: “Python Pocket Reference” by Mark Lutz; O’Reilly Media

### A handy and helpful guide on the current state of Python

As someone who teaches beginning Pythonistas to l1earn to program, this updated
edition of the Python Pocket Reference is worth keeping close at hand.

The reference covers both Python 3.4 and 2.7, and it highlights changes between
the two major releases in a succinct, clear way. Yes, one can find the reference
information in the freely available Python docs, but this guide earns its place
in my backpack by pulling together practical tips, hints, and common gotchas
when using a method or function.

I appreciate the author including a section on the `tkinter` GUI module and tools.
It’s helpful to have the basics in a concise format for the times that I am
troubleshooting a user interface for a laboratory program or helping someone
create a simple status display for an application.

Though it might not be the most exciting read, the Python Pocket Reference does
what it does well – a straightforward, up-to-date resource for Python 3.4 and
2.7. Its hints and common idioms may also save a programmer valuable time
debugging common mistakes.
