# Security and Cryptography Gems

I find cryptography and security fascinating. My current knowledge is limited to some math reading on cryptography years ago and some journal articles in IEEE, ACM, and USENIX publications. As a side project for the next year, I want to build my understanding of practical security out in the real world, especially mobile security.

Returning from AdaCamp Portland and OSBridge, I was inspired to dig into some resources. Here are a few that I believe to be accessible for experienced developers looking to learn more about security:

</p><ul>
	<li>Dr. Terri Oda's PhD thesis, "<a title="Simple Security Policy for the Web" href="https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/theses/31294.pdf" target="_blank">Simple Security Policy for the Web</a>", has highly readable background on web security and attacks. The paper shines when it discusses developing simple security policies that can be easily implemented and therefore used in practice.</li>
	<li>Laurens Van Houten's "<a title="Crypto 101 PyCon 2013 talk" href="http://youtu.be/3rmCGsCYJF8" target="_blank">Crypto 101</a>" talk from PyCon 2013 covers a lot of ground in 45 minutes. I highly recommend watching the entire video (perhaps even several times). The <a title="Crypto 101" href="https://www.crypto101.io/" target="_blank">Crypto 101 website</a> would be a logical next stop to dive a little deeper into the many concepts that are covered in the video.</li>
	<li>Alex Gaynor mentioned a project where he is a contributor that is doing good work in cryptography for the Python community. Check out the docs for <a title="cryptography documentation" href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">cryptography</a>.</li>
</ul>
I enjoyed AdaCamp Portland and OSBridge, and I'm grateful to be have learned about these resources while attending both events.
