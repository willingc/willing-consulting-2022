Audrey Roy and Daniel Greenfeld have recently released **Two Scoops of Django:
Best Practices For Django 1.6** ([Two Scoops Press](http://twoscoopspress.com/)).
Besides helpful books, Audrey and Daniel give much to the Python community by
sharing their experiences with others and encouraging people to get involved
with Python and Django.

Here's my review of this helpful book:

Updated and substantially expanded, I am finding "Two Scoops of Django: Best
Practices For Django 1.6" far exceeds my expectations. I liked the prior version
and found it very useful. The version for Django 1.6 delivers even more best
practices and Django goodness.

Written by two experienced developers, the book presents each major topic in a
concise, user friendly way. The authors pull on their experience to highlight
approaches, tools, and tips that will save a developer valuable time while
increasing code quality. Recognizing that there can be more than one practical
approach on certain topics, they do a great job of alternative tools and
approaches when a topic merits. When presenting alternatives, they point out the
pros and cons as well as offer guidance on when to choose a particular approach.

**New developers**: this is a great book to reach for after completing the official
Django tutorial.

**Experienced developers**: the update gives an excellent reference of current best
practices, reminders, and tips in a clear, friendly way.
