I want take a moment and give special thanks to the 2014-2015 PSF Board for their service and accomplishments.

To the retiring PSF Board members,
I love programming in Python, learning from others, and sharing <a href="http://pyvideo.org/" target="_blank">pyvideo.org</a> talks. To honor the goodness that each of you bring to the Python community, I would like to highlight some of your pyvideo.org talks and celebrate your contributions to Python and our community. Thank you!
