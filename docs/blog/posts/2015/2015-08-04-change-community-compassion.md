# Change, community, and compassion

Today, I reflect on a life changing event. For a few days, we came together
from around the world to form a community to share our thoughts on change and
our compassion for individual experiences in technology.

I'm sharing a very rough draft of a letter that I wrote on May 29, 2014. I
hope you will find a nugget of wisdom, inspiration, or comfort in these
jumbled, unedited yet heartfelt words. I am so grateful for <a
href="https://adacamp.org/" target="_blank">AdaCamp</a> San Francisco 2013 and
its encouragement.

Change, community, and compassion matter. Peace.

> **Unedited text of a draft letter from May 29, 2014**

> It’s been almost one year since I experienced AdaCamp San Francisco.

> Since AdaCamp, I:

> - attended 9 conferences in open source/computing.
> - encouraged more female speakers in my local business and tech community.
> - co-organize PyLadies in my local city and have strived to build a friendly
>   helpful partnerships with our Python and Javascript and entrepreneurship
>   communities.
> - Submitted my first contribution to an open source project (thanks to the
>   GNOME Outreach Program for Women’s encouragement)
> - Made over 100 commits to open source projects over the past year.
> - Served on the PyCon program committee and PyCon poster presenter.
> - I’ve taught and encouraged others – k12 students, undergrad, grad students
>   to men and women reentering the workforce or making a career change.

> I did none of these things because I was “paid” to do so. I did these things
> because they were important to me and my desire to work in a tech community
> that embraces the value of people above hardware and software. Community means
> more than a box of parts and bits flying across a network.

> One size doesn’t fit all. We are individuals – each with our own unique pasts,
> life stories, and aspirations.

> What was AdaCamp’s role in my past year? Informative. Encouraging. Most
> honestly, AdaCamp was life changing.

> AdaCamp

> Listened

> Responded thoughtfully

> Planned – I have never been to a professional event that was more thoughtful
> about food/meal planning, accessibility of facilities, quiet areas, community
> information (medical and crisis).

> Strived to be thoughtful. Inclusive.

> AdaCamp’s impact beyond just the two official days. Genuine women and allies
> at Community Leadership Summit, OSCON, LinuxCon, OpenHardware Summit, Grace
> Hopper, SCALE12x, PyCon, and more.

> For many years, I tried to participate in open source but couldn’t muster the
> confidence to do so. I would gain the confidence and then be discouraged by
> the unclear instructions to contribute. Ultimately, it was easier to work on
> other non-profits where I could make a stronger impact.

> Yet, software development is something I love doing. I enjoy the puzzle of
> putting together solutions to problems.

> GNOME Outreach for Women Program – to make a “real” contribution to an open
> source project. Documentation for another project. It took me several months
> past that to realize that documentation was a “real” contribution in fact it’s
> a big part of how the community communicates to users and developers.

> Safe space. Thoughtful communication. Safe space.

> It’s where I thrive and I’m committed to keeping My neighborhood safe for
> learning, building, and sharing openly.

> It matters and changes the world one person at a time. Does it have to be slow
> if one person at a time? I don’t think so. Call it exponential growth or viral
> but I’m hoping to seeing a big improvement in numbers and diversity before my
> children graduate from college six years from now.

> Giving back through PyLadies and other local outreach efforts.

> Striving to be part of the solution. It’s about people – individuals.

> Gentle, thoughtful has a place in technology and business. It’s not orthogonal
> to good business but instead an essential element of creating and delivering
> meaningful offerings to others in our diverse, complicated world.
