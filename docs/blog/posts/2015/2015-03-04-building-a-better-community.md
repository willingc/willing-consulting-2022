# Building a better community

## Why I gave a $2048 donation to Fab Lab San Diego

**Watching someone bring their idea to life is an amazing reward.**

People from all walks of life have creative ideas. Through grassroots sharing
of ideas, skills, and equipment, [Fab Lab San Diego](http://fablabsd.org)
gives individuals a chance to learn, build, and share their creations. I
believe Fab Lab San Diego's outreach programs inspire students of all ages.
Outreach is hard work but the community benefits are huge.

Please join me in [Fab Lab San Diego ReLaunch](http://igg.me/at/fablabsd/x/3914440)

Donate toward the good work that will be done.
