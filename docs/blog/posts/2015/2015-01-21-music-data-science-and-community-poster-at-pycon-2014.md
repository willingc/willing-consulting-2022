I had the pleasure of sharing my love of music and programming last spring at PyCon 2014. I enjoyed presenting a poster about music21, a computer aided musicology framework. Michael Cuthbert, an MIT professor of Music, has done great work making music theory accessible to learners and researchers.

I believe that music brings together community. One community that I am so pleased to be a participate in is the San Diego Python community (San Diego Python User Group and PyLadies San Diego). Whether it's collaborating in a study group, sharing tips on IRC, or holding workshops for community outreach and knowledge sharing, the San Diego group embraces thoughtfulness, respect, and decency toward others.

It will be my pleasure to share (again) my poster from PyCon 2014 at the upcoming February Data Science Workshop in San Diego. I hope to see some of you there. Here's a brief preview:

Happy listening and creating!
