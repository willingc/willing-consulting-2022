# Moving Forward Monday: The Ada Initiative

![Lady Ada Lovelace](../../assets/images/images/adalovelace.jpg)

If you haven't heard yet about the Ada Initiative, I highly recommend that you
check out the good work that they are doing for women and men in open source
technology
<!-- more -->
Although a relatively young organization, the Ada Initiative has strong
accomplishments: an anti-harassment policy for conferences, practical
workshops teaching skills to men and others wishing to support women in open
source, and AdaCamp. Their website provides much more detail on their growing
impact. Please take a look at the [The Ada Initiative home page](http://adainitiative.org).

If you appreciate the good work that they are doing for all members of open
tech, consider giving them a hand. Support the [The Ada Initiative's](http://adainitiative.org)
work advocating for women in open technology and culture! Become an Adaâ€™s
Angel.
