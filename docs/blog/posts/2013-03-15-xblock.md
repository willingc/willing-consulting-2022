# Learning and Teaching Courses in an Open Environment - XBlock

Kudos for edX opening the technical insides of its very successful platform
for development of content rich learning and course delivery. XBlock, the API,
is available for viewing on GitHub [Git Hub repos for edX](http://www.github.com/edX).
<!-- more -->
Keep an eye on this API opening up creation of more courses, study aids,
collaboration, and customization of the learner's experience.
