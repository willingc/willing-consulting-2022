## Yes, You Can Git

(A Gentle and Practical Introduction to Git and GitHub)

One of the most rewarding workshops which I have taught is
an introduction to Git and GitHub to beginners during the
**Write Speak Code Conference 2016**. It was great to see
people go on to use their new git skills in their jobs and in
open source.

This workshop will be based on the following slidedeck,
[_Yes, You Can Git_](https://www.slideshare.net/willingc/yes-you-can-git).

## Yes, You Can Git (Part 1)

_This will be offered in 2019._

During this two hour online workshop, we'll cover the following:
