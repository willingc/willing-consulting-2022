# Development

I would love to help you build out your ideas and projects. I'm available for
short-term consulting projects. I'm a Python language core developer, a
former Python Steering Council member, and a Python Software Foundation Fellow.
I also am a core developer for JupyterHub, Binder, Jupyter, IPython and
nteract projects (including the popular papermill project).

I have experience working with the following projects and would be happy to discuss
your engineering needs:

- Python: the core language and its application
- Django
- Flask
- Requests
- Hugo
- Pelican
- Nikola
- Kubernetes
- Containers
- CI
- Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter Kernel development
- JupyterHub
- BinderHub
- Python Scientific Stack
- nteract
- Data Science Workflows
- papermill
- CircuitPython
- Sphinx

I also offer electrical engineering work for open hardware and integration of Adafruit
boards and sensors.

Please get in touch. I would enjoy chatting about how I can help you
build your application.
