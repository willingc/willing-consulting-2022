## My mentoring philosophy

Learning software development tools and languages is very similar to
learning to play a musical instrument. Having specific goals with
achievable timeframes helps you move toward success.

Similar to a music lesson, I offer 60 minute mentoring sessions that are
tailored to your needs and goals. You will spend 10 minutes discussing
your goals, 40 minutes learning together, and 10 minutes creating an
action plan for the future.

We'll cover material at your pace in a friendly, supportive learning session.

## Session details

The fee is 60 USD for a 60 minute session. My cancellation policy is
flexible. There is no penalty if you cancel 24 hours before the session.

I believe in you and your ability to meet your goals. Contact me if you
have questions.

Warmly,

Carol
