# Willing Consulting

## Deep Tech for the Real World

### Simplifying open source for forward-thinking businesses

Hi. I’m Carol Willing, an expert in **Python**, **Open Source Governance**, **Data Science**, and **AI**.

I advise early-stage companies on how to use open source effectively. I speak frequently around the world on emerging tech,
open source governance, and inclusive leadership. Whether a business or an audience, I tailor my
work to your needs.

# Carol Willing

I approach life with an
insatiable appetite for learning and a passion for sharing my knowledge with others and learning
alongside them. As a three-time Python Steering member—including serving on the
inaugural council; a Project Jupyter core contributor, and Project Jupyter core
contributor, my dedication to the language can be felt far and wide.
