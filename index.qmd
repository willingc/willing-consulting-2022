# Carol Willing

::: {.hello-quarto-banner}

I approach life with an
insatiable appetite for learning and a passion for sharing my knowledge with others and learning
alongside them. As a three-time Python Steering member—including serving on the
inaugural council; a Project Jupyter core contributor, and Project Jupyter core
contributor, my dedication to the language can be felt far and wide.
