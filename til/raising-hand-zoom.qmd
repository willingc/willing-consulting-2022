A simple tip someone shared with me today but super useful for Zoom calls.
As Zoom's UI evolves, things have moved around. 
I couldn't find the "raise hand" button on a call today.

I learned that there is a keyboard shortcut for raising your hand on Zoom.

Option-Y on macOS {{< kbd mac=Option-Y >}} will raise your hand ðŸ™‹ on Zoom.
