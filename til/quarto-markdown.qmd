In Jupyter and GitHub Markdown, you can create lists with the following syntax
and it will render as a list:

```
There are two types of container images available:
- napari
- napari-xpra
```

In Quarto Markdown, you can use the same syntax to create lists. However, you
must include a blank line before the list items for the list to render correctly:

```markdown
There are two types of container images available:

* napari
* napari-xpra
```
