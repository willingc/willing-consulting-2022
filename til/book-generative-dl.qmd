# Chapter 1: Generative Modeling

## Generative Modeling
- model the probability of observing an observation `x`
- `p(x)`

%%|   Generative model where an observation has many features

    training_data -- training --> generative_model
    generative_model -- "sampling (plus random noise)" --> generated_sample
```

## Discriminative Modeling
- Model the probability of a label `y` given an observation `x`
- `p(y|x)`

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-mermaid

%%| fig-cap: |
%%|   Discriminative model

    training_data -- training --> discriminative_model
    result["Prediction

    discriminative_model -- prediction --> result
```

## Conditional Generative Model
- Model the probability of an observation `x` given a label `y`
- `p(x|y)`

## Representation Learning

high-dimensional data

representation

latent space

encoder-decoder

manifold

::: {.callout-note}
The fundamentalsof representational learning are very similar to the mathematical concepts of non-linear behavior in electrical engineering and digital communications theory.
